## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).

## About

This is just the result of a simple practice work done in spare "work" times while following the Java 8 Lambda Basics Tutorial by Java Brains found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqq-6Pq4lTTa9YGfyhyW2CqdtW9RtY-I3).
